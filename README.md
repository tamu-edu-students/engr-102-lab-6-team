# ENGR 102 Lab Topic 6 (team)
There are three deliverables for this team assignment. Please submit the following files to Gradescope. Please include the team header information at the top of each file with the names of all contributing team members. This is a team assignment, but **everyone** must submit the file for credit. You may discuss the problems with other teams, but your submitted work must be unique. Check out the [Frequently Asked Questions](#frequently-asked-questions) below.

## Activities

1. [Pyramid Area](#pyramid-area)
2. [Approximating ln](#approximating-ln)

## Frequently Asked Questions
1. **When I submit to Gradescope it keeps timing out giving me an error. What gives?** You probably have an infinite loop in your code for one of the tests. To troubleshoot, try adding print statements to the loop's body, or break out of your loop after a certain number of iterations and see what values are stored in your variables.

2. **I'm struggling with loops. Any advice?** Before writing your loop, think about what steps you want to repeat and what order they need to go in. What is your stopping condition? Try solving a few iterations by hand and write out every step you take (including decisions). When do you make a decision? That should be an if-else statement. What steps are you repeating? Those should go inside your loop. If you're still struggling, ask for help during class or office hours.

3. **Pyramid area part 2 how do solve the problem without a loop?** Sometimes we don't need a loop because it's inefficient. Sometimes we can write a mathematical expression (equation) to give us the correct answer. For example, the sum of numbers from 1 to $$n$$ is $$\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$$. Can you come up with an equation for this problem?
